# Transcript

Ragu employs a Fiat-Shamir transform to make the interactive proof protocol
non-interactive. The transcript construction uses
[Poseidon](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458) as the hash function for
challenge generation, modeling it as a
[random oracle](assumptions.md#random-oracle-model).

## Transcript Construction

Ragu's transcript construction differs from standard sponge-based approaches:

- **Single hash function over $\F_p$**: All transcript operations use a
  single Poseidon instance over the circuit field
- **Fixed-length hash usage**: The Poseidon permutation is effectively used
  as a fixed-length hash rather than as a full sponge construction
- **Hybrid commitment scheme**: The transcript combines two cryptographic
  primitives:
  - **Pedersen commitments**: Staging polynomials create Pedersen vector
    commitments (collision-resistant hashes of witness data)
  - **Poseidon hashing**: These commitments, along with other protocol
    elements, are absorbed into the Poseidon-based transcript

This hybrid approach leverages both the algebraic properties of Pedersen
commitments and Poseidon's random oracle properties.
