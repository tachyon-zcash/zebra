# Revdot Product

Step 5 of our [NARK](../nark.md#nark) involves a special case of inner
product relation of the following form:

$$
\Rel_{rdp}=\bigg\{\begin{align*}
\inst&=(\bar{A},\bar{B}\in\G, c\in\F),\\
\wit&=(\v{a},\v{b}\in\F^{4n},\gamma_a,\gamma_b\in\F)\end{align*}:

\begin{align*}
&\phantom{-} \bar{A}=\com(\v{a};\gamma_a) \\
&\land \bar{B}=\com(\v{b};\gamma_b)\\
&\land \revdot{\v{a}}{\v{b}}=c
\end{align*}
\bigg\}
$$

The prover convinces the verifier that the revdot product of two secret
vectors $\v{a}, \v{b}$ equals value $c$ given only their hiding commitments
$\bar{A}, \bar{B}$.
We call these **revdot product relations**.

Revdot products appear in several contexts in the Ragu protocol:

- enforcing an individual circuit's
  [consolidated constraint](../arithmetization.md#consolidated-constraints)
  against its public inputs
- checking [staging polynomials](../../extensions/staging.md)'
  well-formedness via their revdot products with stage mask
  polynomials
- folding the accumulator $\acc.\v{a}, \acc.\v{b}$ from the
  previous PCD step

## Intuition {#intuition}

The revdot product relation is a special case of inner product
relations. Since the
concrete commitment scheme we use, Pedersen Vector commitment, is _linearly
homomorphic_, we can borrow the aggregation technique from Bulletproofs,
which aggregates multiple claims into one via **random linear combination**.

Specifically, given:

$$
\begin{align*}
\wit &:= &\v{a}_0,\ldots,\v{a}_{n-1}, 
&\phantom{-} \v{b}_0,\ldots,\v{b}_{n-1},
&\phantom{-} \set{\gamma_{a,i}, \gamma_{b,i}}\\

\inst &:= &\bar{A}_0,\ldots,\bar{A}_{n-1}, 
&\phantom{-} \bar{B}_0,\ldots,\bar{B}_{n-1},
&\phantom{-} c_0,\ldots,c_{n-1}
\end{align*}
$$

The verifier provides two random challenges $\mu,\nu\in\F$ to aggregate
$n$ revdot claims into one:

$$
\begin{align*}
\wit &:= \v{a}^\ast = \sum_i \mu^{-i}\cdot \v{a}_i,
&\phantom{-} \v{b}^\ast = \sum_i (\mu\nu)^i \cdot \v{b}_i,
&\phantom{-} \sum_i \mu^{-i}\gamma_{a,i}, \sum_i (\mu\nu)^i \gamma_{b,i}\\

\inst &:= \bar{A}^\ast = \sum_i \mu^{-i}\cdot \bar{A}_i,
&\phantom{-} \bar{B}^\ast = \sum_i (\mu\nu)^i\cdot \bar{B}_i,
&\phantom{-} c^\ast = \sum_{i,j} \mu^{j-i} \nu^j e_{i,j}
\end{align*}
$$

where $e_{i,j}=\revdot{\v{a}_i}{\v{b}_j}$, with diagonal elements
$e_{i,i} = c_i$.
The verifier can compute $\bar{A}^\ast, \bar{B}^\ast$ unassisted.
To compute $c^\ast$, the verifier needs _cross terms_ $\set{e_{i,j}}_{i\neq j}$
in addition to the $\set{c_i}$ terms already available. For soundness, **the
prover must send (thus commit to) these cross terms before the verifier samples
$\mu,\nu$**.

```admonish tip title="Off-diagonal Error Terms"
The expanded expression of $c^\ast$ can be viewed as the summation of all cells
in an $n\times n$ matrix where the $(i,j)$-th cell holds the value

$$
\revdot{\mu^{-i}\cdot \v{a}_i}{(\mu\nu)^j \cdot \v{b}_j} = \mu^{j-i} \nu^j \cdot e_{i,j}
$$

for all $i,j \in[n]$.
In this matrix view, all diagonal entries are $\nu^i\cdot c_i$, computable by
the verifier unassisted. All off-diagonal entries (i.e., $i\neq j$) contain
**error terms** that constitute the remaining summands.
The terms _cross terms_ and _error terms_ are used interchangeably.
```

## Revdot Product Reduction

The accumulator instance and witness defined in the split-accumulation scheme
are identical to those of the revdot product relation $\Rel_{rdp}$.
We fold new revdot claims from various sources into $\acc_i$ to
derive $\acc_{i+1}$.
This procedure aggregates all new revdot claims, including the folded claim
in $\acc_i$, into a single claim captured by the updated accumulator.

The split-accumulation proceeds as follows:

1. The prover and verifier parse $\acc_i$ and new revdot claims from proofs
   $\set{\pi_i}$ to be accumulated into the instance-witness pair
   [as above](#intuition).
   The verifier holds $\set{\bar{A}_i,\bar{B}_i, c_i}_{i\in[n]}$.
2. The prover sends all $n^2-n$ (off-diagonal) error terms
   $\set{e_{i,j}}_{i\neq j}$.
3. The verifier samples $\mu,\nu \sample\F$.
4. The prover updates the folded witness:
   $$
   \acc_{i+1}.\wit = (
       \underbrace{\sum_i \mu^{-i}\cdot \v{a}_i}_{\v{a}^\ast},\,
       \underbrace{\sum_i (\mu\nu)^i \cdot \v{b}_i}_{\v{b}^\ast},\,
       \underbrace{\sum_i \mu^{-i}\gamma_{a,i}}_{\gamma_a^\ast},\,
       \underbrace{\sum_i (\mu\nu)^i \gamma_{b,i}}_{\gamma_b^\ast}
   )
   $$

   The verifier updates the folded instance:
   $$
   \acc_{i+1}.\inst = (
       \underbrace{\sum_i \mu^{-i}\cdot \bar{A}_i}_{\bar{A}^\ast},\,
       \underbrace{\sum_i (\mu\nu)^i \cdot \bar{B}_i}_{\bar{B}^\ast},\,
       \underbrace{\sum_{i,j} \mu^{j-i} \nu^j e_{i,j}}_{c^\ast}
   )
   $$
   
The verifier's work consists primarily of $2\cdot \mathsf{MSM}(n)$ to compute
$\bar{A}^\ast, \bar{B}^\ast$, and $O(n^2)$ field multiplications to compute
$c^\ast$.
We introduce the next two techniques to reduce the verifier cost of enforcing
these computations in circuit. We use both techniques in
conjunction, but present them separately for clarity.

## Reducing Commitment Aggregation to Batched Evaluation

Enforcing the computation of $\bar{A}^\ast$ and $\bar{B}^\ast$ requires linear
combination of commitments in circuit. A direct implementation
involves non-native
arithmetic to constrain scalar multiplications. Instead, Ragu transforms the
commitment aggregation statement into a PCS multi-opening claim, then piggybacks
on the existing [batched evaluation](./pcs.md) for accumulation.

The aggregation of homomorphic commitments $\bar{A}_i$ corresponds
to aggregation
of their underlying polynomials $a_i(X)$. We can _spot check_ the constituent
polynomials and the aggregated polynomial at an arbitrary point $\beta\in\F$.
If their evaluations follow the expected linear combination relation, _and_ the
PCS evaluation claims are valid, then $\bar{A}^\ast$ is correct
with overwhelming probability.

$$
\begin{align*}
\bar{A}^\ast \in\G = \sum_i \mu^{-i}\cdot \bar{A}_i 
&\equiv a^\ast(X) = \sum_i \mu^{-i}\cdot a_i(X) \\
&\implies 
    \begin{cases}
        \set{(\bar{A}_i, \beta, a_i(\beta))}_i \quad\text{are valid PCS evals}\\
        (\bar{A}^\ast, \beta, a^\ast(\beta)) \quad\text{is a valid PCS eval}\\
        a^\ast(\beta) = \sum_i \mu^{-i}\cdot a_i(\beta)
    \end{cases}
    \quad\text{for } \beta\sample\F
\end{align*}
$$

After the reduction, the linear combination of evaluations can be natively
enforced, and the $(n+1)$ PCS claims are incorporated into a batched evaluation
accumulation together with other PCS claims in the Ragu protocol.

This reduction has lower amortized cost. In [step 7 of PCS
aggregation](./pcs.md#pcs-aggregation), there is only _one scalar multiplication
per queried polynomial_ regardless of the number of queried points on it.
If some $a_i(X)$ is already queried elsewhere in the protocol, our reduction
leads to fewer scalar multiplications in total.
Furthermore, all group operations are
[deferred](../../prelim/nested_commitment.md#deferred-operations) to avoid
non-native arithmetic.

## Multi-layer Revdot Reduction

The previous section addressed the cost of commitment aggregation.
Another challenge arises from the $O(n^2)$ field operations to
derive $c^\ast$.
When folding many revdot claims (e.g., $n=133$ in Ragu's fuse operation), the
single-reduction approach above requires $n^2 = 17689$ field multiplications,
exceeding the targeted circuit size limit.
Smaller circuits are preferable (even if requiring more circuits
per step) because
they lead to smaller witness commitments, which lead to smaller IPA proofs,
ultimately yielding faster verifier times.

To address this, we employ a **two-layer reduction** scheme parameterized by
$(M, N)$ that folds up to $M \cdot N$ claims using roughly $NM^2 + N^2 - N + 3$
constraints instead of $(M \cdot N)^2$.

### Two-Layer Structure

The two-layer scheme works as follows:

- _Partition_: Group the $M \cdot N$ input claims into $N$ groups
  of $M$ claims each.
- _Layer 1_: Using challenges $\mu, \nu \sample \F$, fold each group of $M$
   claims into a single claim, producing $N$ intermediate claims.
- _Layer 2_: Using fresh challenges $\mu', \nu' \sample \F$, fold the $N$
   intermediate claims into one final claim.

This hierarchical approach reduces the quadratic blowup by processing claims in
smaller batches first, then combining the results.

### Two-Layer Reduction

Given initial revdot claims indexed as
$\set{(\bar{A}_i, \bar{B}_i, c_i)}_{i \in [M\cdot N]}$,
the accumulation proceeds:

1. The prover and verifier partition claims into $N$ groups of $M$ claims each.
2. Layer 1:
   - The prover sends all error terms
     $\set{e^{(g)}_{i,j}}_{g\in[N], i\neq j, i,j\in[M]}$
     (i.e., $N$ groups of $M(M-1)$ error terms each).
   - The verifier samples $\mu, \nu \sample \F$.
   - Both parties compute $N$ intermediate claims. For each group $g \in [N]$:
     $$
     \bar{A}^{(g)} = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \mu^{-i} \bar{A}_{gM+i},\quad
     \bar{B}^{(g)} = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} (\mu\nu)^i \bar{B}_{gM+i},\quad
     c^{(g)} = \sum_{i,j\in[M]} \mu^{j-i} \nu^j e^{(g)}_{i,j}
     $$
3. Layer 2:
   - The prover sends error terms $\set{e_{g,h}}_{g\neq h, g,h\in[N]}$
     (i.e., $N(N-1)$ cross-terms between intermediate claims).
   - The verifier samples fresh $\mu', \nu' \sample \F$.
   - Both parties compute the final folded claim:
     $$
     \bar{A}^\ast = \sum_{g=0}^{N-1} (\mu')^{-g} \bar{A}^{(g)},\quad
     \bar{B}^\ast = \sum_{g=0}^{N-1} (\mu'\nu')^g \bar{B}^{(g)},\quad
     c^\ast = \sum_{g,h\in[N]} (\mu')^{h-g} (\nu')^h e_{g,h}
     $$

The key insight is that fresh challenges $\mu', \nu'$ in layer 2 are independent
from $\mu, \nu$ in layer 1, since the Schwartz-Zippel soundness
argument applies independently at each layer.

### Complexity Analysis

For folding $M \cdot N$ claims via two layers with parameters $(M, N)$:

- Layer 1: Precompute $\mu\nu$ and $\mu^{-1}$ ($2$ constraints), then fold
  $N$ groups of $M$ claims using nested Horner evaluation ($N(M^2 - 1)$ constraints),
  totaling $NM^2 - N + 2$ constraints
- Layer 2: Precompute $\mu'\nu'$ and $(\mu')^{-1}$ ($2$ constraints), then fold
  $N$ intermediate claims using nested Horner evaluation ($N^2 - 1$ constraints),
  totaling $N^2 + 1$ constraints
- Total: $(NM^2 - N + 2) + (N^2 + 1) = NM^2 + N^2 - N + 3$ constraints

Compared to a single-layer reduction of the same $M \cdot N$ claims, which
requires $(M \cdot N)^2 + 1$ constraints, this is a significant improvement.

For Ragu's parameters $M=7, N=19$ (supporting up to $133$ claims):

- Two-layer: $19 \cdot 49 + 361 - 19 + 3 = 1276$ constraints
- Single-layer: $133^2 + 1 = 17690$ constraints
- Savings: $\sim 93\%$ reduction
