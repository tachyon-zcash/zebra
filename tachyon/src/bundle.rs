//! Tachyon transaction bundles.

//! A bundle is parameterized by its stamp state:
//!
//! - [`StampedBundle`] (`Bundle<Stamp>`) — has a stamp
//! - [`StrippedBundle`] (`Bundle<Stripped>`) — stamp stripped, merged into another bundle
//!
//! Actions are constant through state transitions; only the stamp
//! is stripped or merged.
